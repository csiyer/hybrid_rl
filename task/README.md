Hello! This is an implementation of the task from [this paper](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0000231), [this paper](https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article-abstract/31/10/1455/95333/Modulating-the-Use-of-Multiple-Memory-Systems-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext), and [this paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/81679). More precisely, it's an imitation of a version of this task used in an unpublished fMRI experiment. It is implemented with jsPsych 8, with stimuli not included here but shareable upon request!
